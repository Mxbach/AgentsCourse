# 🤗 AI Agents Course – Hugging Face

Welcome to my personal repository for the **Hugging Face AI Agents Course**!  
This repo contains my notes, code, solutions, experiments, and additional resources as I work through the course — from fundamentals to advanced agent building.

## 📚 About the Course

The Hugging Face AI Agents Course covers:

- Agent fundamentals (tools, thoughts, actions, observations)
- Hands-on work with agent frameworks:
  - `smolagents`
  - `LlamaIndex`
  - `LangGraph`
- Real-world use cases and agentic RAG (retrieval-augmented generation)
- Final project and optional bonus units:
  - Fine-tuning LLMs for function calling
  - Agent observability & evaluation
  - Agents in games (e.g., Pokémon battles!)
